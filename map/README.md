Found this [map by someone else](https://www.google.com/maps/@54.4749724,-4.1148165,6.24z/data=!4m2!6m1!1s1yBKNTNQqk2pWlN9Y66EJNhUlbrg).

But it was old, so I wanted to create [my own](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1lSuA4BePXoKkBVywDFvcDqcqls_S-_E).

Usage:
```
kotlinc -script map.main.kts
```
(Note: all dependencies and source code is in one file, only requirement is [Kotlin CLI](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/command-line.html), 1.7+ preferred.)
